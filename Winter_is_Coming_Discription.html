          <h2>Project Description</h2>
          <p>
            This project is defined as creating a system that controls
            RGB(Red-Green-Blue) LEDs(Light Emitting Diodes) to effectively
            control indoor plant growth during the winter season in Oregon.
            Oregon’s winters are a hostile environment to grow specialty plants
            such as herbs, spices, or foreign plants. The conditions outside
            will be much colder, darker, and humid than the summer months. These
            plants are not expected to grow well or even survive in such
            conditions. Bringing the plants indoors to a more friendly and
            manageable environment can prove to be a difficult task. Existing
            indoor light systems can be expensive, and difficult to customize
            and use. Research provided to the project by the client has shown
            that some plants grow differently under different
            wavelengths(colors) of light. The project will aim to produce a
            system that can control the color, intensity, and schedule of a set
            of RGB LEDs in a user friendly manner. With custom control over the
            growing conditions, the plants will be allowed to grow well, while
            at the same time reducing the impact on the user’s busy life. The
            developed system will include a microprocessor that will manipulate
            the color, intensity, and schedule of the RGB LEDs. Along side this
            hardware, the development of an intuitive user interface will allow
            an end user to interact with the system with minimal physical
            interaction. The project is simple at its core, but many additional
            features have been developed to increase functionality and end
            usability.
          </p>
          <h2>Problem Description</h2>
          <p>
            During the cold and dark winter months, plant growth becomes
            difficult at best, and calamitous at worst. In our state of Oregon
            we are well accustomed to overcast, low temperatures, and rain
            throughout the winter, spring, and fall months. Our client has a
            desire to grow herbs and plants indoors during these long, cold
            months. Solving this problem is a desire held by all members of our
            team. Much like our client, we enjoy cooking with fresh herbs and
            vegetables even through the winter.
          </p>

          <p>
            Many plants and herbs such as tomatoes, basil, ferns, and plants
            from foreign climates have an ideal set of environmental conditions
            that allow for optimum growth. Variables such as light wavelength,
            intensity, temperature, moisture, and pests all have an impact on a
            plant’s health and yield. These factors lead many growers to bring
            their plants indoors during the winter months.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even in a climate controlled dwelling, the problem persists. Humans
            and plants require very different living conditions. Residents come
            and go from work, school, and vacation while plants have evolved to
            expect the 24hr day-night cycle. Busy humans can leave plants
            neglected or without light for days. Current interior plant lighting
            systems can be expensive and offer little to no customization. Plant
            growth systems that do not adapt to both the requirements of their
            plants and their gardener’s schedule lead to frustration, low plant
            yield, and plant death.
          </p>

          <h2>Proposed Solution</h2>
          <p>
            The client’s primary concern is solving the problem of interior
            plant lighting. The features required to do this are clearly defined
            in the required features section, but specific implementation
            details were left to our team. Each of us have skills in an area
            related to this project, and together we have the ability to go
            above and beyond what was requested by the client. We have built the
            set of additional features listed below that we believe compliment
            the client’s vision for this project.
          </p>

          <p>
            Given proper design and documentation, the additional features are
            likely to be completed barring any complications. Features that are
            especially difficult to accomplish, unlikely to be completed, or are
            outside the primary scope of the project are listed as stretch
            goals.

          <h2>Performance Metrics</h2>
          <p>
            Defining performance metrics for this project has been a back and forth topic for this team. 
            The client’s requirements are easily met by a team of four people, but our internal expectations 
            are much higher. To avoid feature bloat and to guarantee the product functions per the client’s 
            requirements at a minimum, the features below describe the features necessary to define the 
            project as a success. Extra features will be added after the completion of these functionally 
            required features.
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>All features described by the client</strong> listed in section <i>Required features are complete.</i>
              </li>
              <li>
                An alternative interface as described in <i>Additional features</i>.   An interface that allows all controller settings to be modified without <i>physical access to the controller</i>. 
                <ul>
                  <li>This interface will likely be a web server hosted on the controller, but is subject to change as the project evolves.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <h2>What I Learned</h2>
          <p>
            This project was done for my senior design course that had me work with three other people to complete this
            project over the course of 9 months. This project had us create an RGB plant lighting system. I had experience working
            with RGB LEDs before from other personal projects but had never done something this large before. 
          </p>
          <p>
            One of the largest things I learned while working on this project was how to work with other software 
            developers on the same project. Up to this point the only projects I worked on were small projects for class or personal projects by 
            myself. So working with three other developers to work with a client, come up with what is realistically doable  
            within the time given to us to accomplish the desired outcome of the client and then implement that plan was a large learning experience for me.
            This allowed me to learn a little about how the real world works when working with a group of developers.  
          </p>
          <p>
            During my time at Oregon State University the main Languages we used was C++. This is part of the reason we chose to do a lot of 
            the back end in C++. We would come to regret making this decision when it came to working with web requests and creating an API. 
            C++ requires a lot of setup and is a low level Languages an there were not many libraries that were not overly bloated for our 
            project so creating our own was a struggle and taught me that it is important to look at all options and really think if this is 
            the best option for the project as it grows. 
          </p>
