          <h2>Project Description</h2>
          <p>
            This project was done while working at the college of engineering computer help desk 
            at Oregon State University. This was to replace a poorly designed and implemented scheduling system 
            developed by pervious students. The goal of this project was to create a simpler, faster, and more reliable 
            scheduling system that allowed its users to up their shifts that they could not make up so that other 
            coworkers could take them if they wish. We wanted people to be able to create a term long work schedule 
            that could be viewed when logged in. It would then show the user its shifts for the full term and allow them 
            to be put up so someone else can take them. We also wanted to send out daily list of currently available shifts 
            to notify people that someone put their shift up to be taken. 
          </p>
          <p>
            This was the first project that I worked on with another person and had to coordinate what each of us were
            working on and how we were implementing the features that we were working on. This was also the first project I worked 
            on that other people were going to use regularly and that allowed us to be able to get feedback to make improvements and 
            add more features as we went through the school year. 
          </p>
          <h2>Project Features</h2>
          <p>
            <ul class="container-center skills">
              <li>User Sign-Up</li>
              <li>User Login</li>
              <li>Term Long Schedule Creation</li>
              <li>Shift Trading</li>
              <li>Daily Emails</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <h2>What I Learned</h2>
          <p>
            There were a lot of parts of this project that I learned a lot
            about. This was the first project that I worked on that I had to
            manage passwords and users information. So I learned a lot about how
            to store and access them in a secure way. This lead to me
          </p>
          <p>
            One aspect of the project that people wanted was email notifications
            of shifts that were available to be picked up and I had never worked
            with regularly scheduled emails so I had to learn a lot about how it
            was done and most commonly implemented. Thats when I learned about
            NodeMailer and node scheduler. Th is allowed for easy templates of
            emails and cron like scheduling.
          </p>
          <p>
            This project was the first project I worked on that other people
            would be using. This allowed me to learn about how to take feedback
            from users and incorporate that into changes made to the platform.
          </p>
