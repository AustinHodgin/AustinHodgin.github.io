          <h2>Project Description</h2>
          <p>
            This project is broken up into two parts. The first part is the
            sorting algorithm visualization and the second part is a path
            finding algorithm visualization. I choose these two types of
            algorithms to visualize because I thought they looked intreating and
            their algorithms are used commonly within programming. I wanted to
            practice and learn more about just pure JavaScript so I wanted this
            project to be done in as pure JavaScript as possible.
          </p>
          <h3>Sorting Algorithms</h3>
          <p>
            This section of the project focused on creating a sorting algorithm
            visualizer. I wanted to be able to show the difference between how
            the different sorting algorithms worked and could be implemented.
            When you enter the page you are greeted with a side bar full of
            options and a blank canvas. These options are the number of elements
            that will be sorted and displayed, which sorting algorithm that will
            be visualized, the case (Best, Worst, Average) the arry is in and
            then finally how long you want each step will take in milliseconds.
            Once a sorting algorithm is selected the summary and pseudo code is
            filled in with information about that algorithm. The summary section
            describes how the algorithm works as well as shows the Big O
            complexity of the given algorithm. The pseudo code section gives a
            basic idea of the code required to implement the algorithm. This is
            not the exact code used to create the visualization of the algorithm
            as they needed to be change slightly to be able to visualize them.
            Once all the options are selected and the user presses start the
            canvas will fill bars representing the values within the array. It
            will then start applying the sorting algorithm to the arry. When two
            elements are being compared they will be highlighted in green. If
            they then need to swap they will be highlighted in red. This is done
            to shows how many comparisons and swaps are required to completely
            sort the array. Currently there are four sorting algorithms
            implemented.

          </p>
          <h2>What I Learned</h2>
          <h4>Sorting Algorithms</h4>
          <p>
            Starting this part of the project I had never done any visualization
            or graphics work before. I learned a lot about how the HTML canvas
            worked and the powerful things it can do. I learned that I was not
            able to translate directly from the algorithm to draw on the canvas.
            If I did that it would be over very quickly for small to medium size
            arrays making it difficult to see how the algorithm works. To slow
            the process down I had to take steps to create an actions array that
            would capture the steps that would need to be taken so that they
            could be animated within this canvas. Once the action array was
            created I was able to get it to be able to be stepped through in a
            fashion that would be able to be animated. This gave me more control
            over how the animation worked and the speed in which it could be
            stepped through.
